A great restaurant website design is not just beautiful, but effective as well. While some website designers focus strictly on the visual aspects, which can be easy to get carried away with when dealing with restaurants and food, others simply focus on creating a simple and useful webpage that is straight to the point. An effective webpage for some restaurant blends both the visual aspects and usefulness into one design. Itâ€™s not easy to do and most restaurants are severely lacking in proper execution of their web presence.

The perfect restaurant webpage design allows customers to find information like menus, location, hours of operation and contact info easily without too much distraction. However the customer must also get a sense of what this restaurant is about, their atmosphere, service and quality of food through the design aspects of the website.

I have developed that well designed restaurant and food webpage that I believe have successfully followed this idea. Take a look for yourself and get inspired by this restaurant webpage design.
